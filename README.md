#### Groundless Opinions on the Modern Resume
> A good resume will not get you the job; a bad resume will definitely not get you the job.

I am going to pontificate for a moment on the real value of a resume in the overall job searching process. A resume serves two purposes: (1) to quickly weed out weak candidates; and (2) form the foundation of a situational interview.

That is to say, very few people will care about the amazing skills you list, the wonderful places you've worked, or the big name schools you attended. Sorry >_<
