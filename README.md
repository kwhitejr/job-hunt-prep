## Overview

I'm going to pontificate for a moment on the actual value of a resume in the overall job searching process. A resume serves two purposes: (1) to quickly weed out weak candidates; and (2) form the foundation of a situational interview. Therefore your resume (1) must be grammatically, syntactically, an stylistically spotless; and (2) tell a good story or stories.

What actually gets you the job will be (1) how you present your portfolio; (2) the content of your portfolio; (3) your interview; and (4) who you know (this is probably the most important factor).

I hope this guide helps you better prepare or polish one or more of those things.

Some terms
* Situational Interview: the interview where they ask you questions about how you'd react to or operate in different situations.
* Technical Interview: the interview where they ask you technical questions about how to solve a given problem; often includes whiteboarding, psuedo code, etc.

## Resume

#### Groundless Opinions on the Modern Resume

It's been my experience that the only time someone asked about my resume was when I was sitting across from them in a situational interview. The resume formed the basis of the questions asked and guided the context of my responses. Since you are writing your own resume, you thus have an ideal opportunity to shape your future situational interview.

#### Resume Do's
* Header: Include your name, address, telephone, email, GitHub link, LinkedIn link, portfolio link. Add/substract links as appropriate for the position.
* Ordering Sub-sections: As an aspiring developer, you probably have sub-sections on Work Experience, Projects, Education, and Interests. There is no correct order, but these information most pertinent to the job you're applying for should come first. For example, when applying for a junior developer position and having never worked as a developer before, I argue that your Education and Projects are much more important than your previous Work Experience.
* Education: This is the one place where I think it is okay to use pure lists. See example below.
* Projects & Work Experience (Part 1): This is the meat of your resume (sorry, vegans). Each Project should tell a story about what you did and how you succeeded while working on it. Remember, the goal is not to list everything you did; rather, write something that make the reader curious to know more and will form the basis of a memorable interview conversation. The same logic applies to Work Experience: most of what you did day to day was mundane; focus on interesting stories.
* Projects & Work Experience (Part 2): What stories shoudl you be thinking of? **Success Anecdotes**. For every Project and Work Experience, think about a time you were given a problem to solve. How did you solve it and what was the result of your success? What impact did you make? This is the narrative you want to tell. 
* Projects & Work Experience (Part 3): **Framing**. For almost all of your Projects and most of your employers, the reader might not know what it is or why its important. I like to dedicate my first bullet point to quickly providing context about the project/employer in order to frame the narrative. This can also give you an opportunity to puff up the experience. For example: "
* Interests: This can be relatively short, but should also form the basis for a narrative. For example, "I speak fluent Swahili" (bad) vs "I use my fluent Swahili to tutor orphans" (good).
* Bullet points: I argue in favor of consistent, clean grammatical style. This will help the reader easily frame what you are trying to convey. Specifically, "I" is the implied subject of every sentence on the resume, and therefore can be dropped. Every main verb should be either past tense or present tense, depending on whether you are still at the job or project. 
* Clickable links: have them; make sure they work. If someone is curious about what you've written, there should be no barrier in them getting to your work. Also double check your links are working before sending out a resume.
* Bullet points: End every sentence with a period. We're not savages.
* Length: Don't go beyond two pages (remember, this advice is for junior or newish tech people).

#### Resume Don't's
* Don't start a bullet point with anything other than a verb.
* Don't use every verb you can find in the thesaurus. Use the appropriate language.
* Generally, stay away from adverbs.
* Don't have any grammatical errors.
* Don't use inconsistent styles (formatting, fonts, font-sizes, etc). If a heading is bold and underlined, then every heading must be bold and underlined. 

#### LinkedIn
For LinkedIn, you want to follow the same guidelines. The main advantage is that you are not fighting a page-limit, so put your entire history down.

#### Markdown Gist
I keep a "living resume" in Markdown on a Gist because knowing Markdown is cool. Also, if you want to apply to the [Microsoft LEAP] (http://www.industryexplorers.com/) program you need to have one.
